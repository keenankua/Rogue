|COMPILATION|
---------------
In the A3 directory, compile with the makefile by entering the following command:

make


|USAGE|
---------
Run the executable with the following:

./a.out ./assets/<roomFile.txt>

Replace <roomFile.txt> with the appropriate room file in the assets folder.


|TESTING|
-----------
Program has been tested for the following cases:
- Passing of existing and non-existent files while running the executable
- Properly formatted room file
- A2 specifications (ie. 6 rooms, each room size <= 18X23)
- A3 specifications (ie. use of potions, full inventory, combat, etc)
- Several doors on each wall and corresponding hallways
- Several small/large monsters in each room
- Blocking monsters on their patrol


|KNOWN LIMITATIONS|
---------------------
- Non-existent file names passed in for reading
- Reading in lines longer than 150 characters from the room file
- Assumes room file is perfectly formatted
- Assumes room file follows specifications perfectly
- Ncurses causes valgrind to detect memory leaks. No leaks were found when the ncurses code was commented out in main.c
- The game is programmed such that only the hero can initiate combat
- In the event that a monster is blocked, it will continue the next move in its patrol on the next turn (not really a 
limitation but it may look odd)
